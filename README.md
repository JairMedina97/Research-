# Research- Reservoir Engineering code
## Internship at the IMP Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo
### During my internship experience I learned how to perform some code in Fortran 90 and learn how foam is feasible and if can be useful as an Enhanced Oil Recovry EOR method to efficiently manage oil production in naturally fractured reservoirs.
### Part of my learning experience was to modify the code from homogeneous porous medium like a sandstone to an heterogeneous porous and fractured limestone medium with randomly assigned fractures in the numerical simulation.
